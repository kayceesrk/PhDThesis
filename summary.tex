\chapter{Concluding Remarks and Future Work}
\label{chap:conclusion}

A strongly consistent view of data, which enables the programmer to treat
parallel and distributed architectures as a centralized system, is at odds with
practical concerns such as availability, coherence, latency, and partial
failures. Hence, modern multicore and distributed systems only provide weak
consistency guarantees, belying the semblance of a centralized system, which
complicates concurrent programming. In this dissertation, we presented three
novel techniques for programming under weak consistency. \MMSCC provides a
coherent and managed shared memory for programmers on the non-cache coherent
Intel SCC processor. \rxcml enables synchronous communication to be utilized as
an abstraction over asynchronous distributed systems. \quelea permits
declarative reasoning about consistency guarantees for programs over eventually
consistent data stores.

\section{Future Work}

In this section, we present the future work. This discussion is split based on
the three contributions.
