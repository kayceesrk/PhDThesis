\begin{abstract}

In recent years, there has been a wide-spread adoption of both multicore and
cloud computing. Traditionally, concurrent programmers have relied on the
underlying system providing \emph{strong memory consistency}, where there is a
semblance of concurrent tasks operating over a shared global address space,
with reads to a memory location witnessing the latest write to the same
location. However, providing scalable strong consistency guarantees as the
scale of the system grows is an increasingly difficult endeavour. In a
multicore setting, the increasing complexity and the lack of scalability of
hardware abstractions such as on-chip cache coherence deters scalable strong
consistency. In geo-distributed compute clouds, the latency and availability
concerns in the presence of partial failures prohibit strong consistency.
Hence, modern multicore and cloud computing platforms eschew strong consistency
in favor of weakly consistent memory, meaning that each task has a view of
memory that is incomparable with the other tasks. As a result, programmers on
these platforms must tackle the full complexity of concurrent programming for
an asynchronous distributed system.

This dissertation argues that functional programming language abstractions can
mitigate the complexity of programming weakly consistent systems. It presents
three major contributions, each focussed on addressing a particular challenge
associated with weakly consistent loosely coupled systems: (1) the absence of
cache coherence, (2) asynchrony and (3) eventual consistency. First, it
describes \MM, a parallel extension of MLton Standard ML compiler and runtime,
and shows how to provide an efficient cache coherent global address space on
top of the \emph{non-cache-coherent} Intel Single-chip Cloud Computer (SCC).
Next, it describes \rxcml, a distributed extension of \MM and shows that, with
the help of speculative execution, synchronous communication can be utilized as
an efficient abstraction for programming asynchronous distributed systems.
Finally, it presents the \quelea, a programming system for \emph{eventually
consistent} distributed stores, and shows that the choice of correct
consistency level for replicated data type operations and transactions can be
automated with the help of high-level declarative \emph{contracts}.
